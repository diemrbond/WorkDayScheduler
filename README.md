# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
UWA Project, Week 5

![picture](./assets/images/Screenshot.png)

## Project Description
For this project we needed to create a simple Calendar app, using moment.js and jQuery. The colours of each time block needed to update with the time, based on past, present and future. The entries needed to be stored in localStorage, to be retrieved on page refresh.

The main goal was:
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
